# automationcrap

A collection of small Python automation scripts I build while learning.

This repo is a dumping ground for practical tools that automate boring tasks, mostly around files and directories. Scripts are added as I come up with new ideas or need something useful.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the scripts directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kinquiz/automationcrap.git
cd automationcrap
python script_name.py
